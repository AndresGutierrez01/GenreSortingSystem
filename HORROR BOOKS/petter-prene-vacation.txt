Vacation





For all my YouTube-fans! I wish you a Happy Halloween!





Chapter I


“Come on, guys!” - Fredrik said as he pulled two cards from the Uno card pit. Alina gave him the eyes she always gives him, we all knew she had a crush on him. Alina was that kind of girl that nobody saw as a “girl” and more like a “friend”. “I wanna go to Comic con” - Said Marcus. Marcus was the fat, a little nerdy guy that would stay at home and play video games instead of go out and do stuff. He always had a simple t-shirt on together with his glasses. “We need to go to a real place, I’m thinking beaches, shots, strippers!” - Said Fredrik. Fredrik was the leader out of us, he always decided if we were going anywhere or which kind of pizza we wanted. But there was something about him.... He never spoke about his parents or what they work with, just like he didn’t know. And then there’s me, Jordan, Living a normal life with friends and family.

-Florida! - Exclaimed Fredrik

-Sounds good to me! - Said Alina

-I don’t know.. - Said Marcus

“Why not? You need to take a break from shooting eleven year olds in Cod PLUS you need to see more girls than your mum” - Said Fredrik

-Fuck you, Fredrik..

-He’s kinda right, Marcus - I said. I mean we need to have some fun sometimes and after all, we’re nineteen now, we can do pretty much everything!



Fredrik took his laptop and started to search for hotels in Florida



-I’ve heard they have this cool Halloween attraction - Fredrik said

-Why would we visit a Halloween attraction in April? - I said

-Well, that’s not all. We still have sun, food and girls! So what do you guys think?

-Fuck it, I’m in! - I said

-Me too - Said Alina



We all put our eyes on Marcus as he was the last one to decide if we should go. “Come on Marcus, you need to get your fat ass outside” - I thought for myself. “Okay then” He finally said.



-Fuck yeah! Let’s book a hotel for four! - Fredrik said

-I can be with Fredrik - Alina said quickly



Of course she wanted, but why? Fredrik was the biggest douche ever. I don’t even know why we kept hanging out with him. We just couldn’t get rid of him. Wherever we went, he followed.



“Then I and Marcus can go in the same room” - I said



-There’s a plane available tomorrow - Fredrik said

-Tomorrow already? Well.. Why not? - I said





Chapter II


I came home around seven. Toby (My dog) greeted me with his normal welcome, waved his tail and jumped in excitement. He probably wanted some food after a long afternoon alone.



-I’m gonna be away for a few days, Toby

-(Aw, c'mon man, I don’t wanna be alone)

-No worries, I’ll soon be back. My parents will take care of you.

-(Okay, daddy. Now I shall sleep)



Am I insane?



I reached for my laptop and logged onto the Internet. I was curios about the stuff to do in Florida, so I searched on Google: “Tourist attractions in Florida”. I clicked the link saying “Visit Florida”. I was sent to a site looking pretty normal, I saw ads for nightclubs, Hotels and sunny beaches. I also saw that Halloween attraction. I still couldn’t understand why’d they would have that in the middle of April. Suddenly I heard a knock on my door. I went to open. It was Marcus.



-Marcus? Whats up? - I asked

-Fine, but we won’t be - He said

-What are you talking about?



He took a deep breath.



-I just saw on Twitter that three girls who went on vacation to Florida just disappeared

-So? It’s an entire state, Marcus. People get lost everyday

-Yeah, I know. But these girls went to the exact same hotel with the exact same plane as we are!

-Don’t worry, Marcus. They’re probably just hiding to get attention or something

-Yeah, you’re right. I’m just being paranoid

-Yeah.. Don’t forget to pack, we’ll meet at Fredrik’s tomorrow

-Laters - He said and left



Later that night I had a dream. In the dream I was walking closer and closer to this “Halloween attraction”. I approached the main door. There was a sign saying “Your soul here” and pointed towards the door. I slowly touched the door knob and twisted it. As I was just about to ask “hello?” I flew in the building with top speed! “NOOOOOOOO” I screamed as I flew further in. I could see how everything got burning red and in the end of the tunnel I could see a big fire. As I heard the screams of souls being tortured I got closer to the fire. Finally I heard an inhuman dark voice saying: “Thank you for your soul!”



ZAP! I woke up from a thunder probably hitting the ground 50 feet from my house. I was sweating from fear. The phone rang. “Who would call 4 in the morning?” I thought. It was Fredrick.



-What’s up asshole?! - He said

-What do you want?

-I’m just calling to say that I have now booked the hotel rooms!

-Why would you say that in the middle of the night?

-Because I booked on your e-mail address!



“Why” I was about to ask. But I knew the answer. The answer was “Fredrik”, this is something he would do.



-Okay then

-Sleep well, bitch

-Yeah, Fuck you too..



I hung up and went to sleep again.





Chapter III


The next morning, I woke up to the Tv that Toby had turned on for me. He was a smart dog, I knew he could turn on the Tv just to wake me up. I checked my phone and saw that I had an unread email, it was from “Mark’s travel” - The booking company. “Thanks for booking your Vacation with us”. I started my computer to view the email on a bigger screen. “BUZZ” My phone vibrated, it was another email but not from Mark’s travel. It was from the email address “Tom_jackson.floridahealthcare@gmail.com”. What is this? - I thought. “Visit Florida’s best Halloween attraction” - The title said. I thought that they really wanted people’s attention.

I met up with Fredrik, Alina and Marcus at Fredrik’s house “Are you guys ready to go?” - Fredrik said. In the car on the way to the airport I told them about the dream I had.

- Seriously, bro, that is fucked up! I told you guys this was a bad idea! - Whined Marcus

- Same old Fatty Mc Nerd Marcus! It was a dream! Nothing more, nothing less. Let Jordan dream, he needs a break from his wet dreams anyways. Besides, this “dream” is just another reason to go visit that Halloween spookzy place. - Said Fredrik

- The only one here who has wet dreams are you, Fredrik - I said

- Yeah! Dreaming about all these girls that I’m gonna bang in the nightclubs of Florida!

- Not as long as I’m here - Said Alina

- Yeah, right..

Why does Alina keep trying? It’s obvious that Fredrik isn’t interested at all. If I just happen to be in a certain death situation with Alina, I would totally tell her.



The plane trip was just plain boring...hehe… Everyone fell asleep before me, as usual. I had nothing to do so I thought I’d do some research on the area around the hotel. I googled the hotel and a few links popped up. The first few links were just advertisements for the hotel and the stuff around it (the Halloween attraction as well). But then I saw a link leading to the local news site, “The three young girls is still to be found”. This must be the girls that Marcus was talking about. I clicked the link. It was a mainstream news site with ads on the right and a story on the left. I read the story: “On Monday Februarie 2nd, Three girls from the New York area went on a trip to Florida with Mark’s travel. They went at 8:15 AM and the last anyone ever heard of them since was 11:23 PM the same day when One of the girls called his brother.



Police are searching

Police are desperately searching the area but not a single clue has been found about the three girls. We send our prayers to them and thair familly. If you know or have seen anything related to this, please contact us or their family.”



“So they are legit gone?” - I thought for my self.





Chapter IV


We arrived at the Hotel and checked in. Fredrik and Alina got the room 69. Marcus and I got the room 314. The hotel were massive for a 4-star one. It had paintings on the wall and free breakfast for everyone. I pushed my card against the door to unlock it. *click* The door was opened. In the room there were two beds a Tv and a Bathroom, nothing special. Marcus sat down in his bed.



-I’m taking this one! - He said

- Whatever you say, Marcus.

- Hey, Jordan. Ehh.. I just wanted to say that you’re a true friend. Not like Fredrik or Alina. You’re actually good.

- Thanks man! - I said. But why are you telling me this?

- Because.. you know.. the girls..

- Come on, man! You’re still thinking of that?

- I’m sorry. I just can’t help it.. What if we are next?

- Don’t be ridiculous! Of course we aren’t! Let’s just have a great time here in Florida!

- I know, man. I.. I’m sorry.



Marcus and I had been friends since pre school. We used to play videogames together on Friday nights. His mum always baked sweet cookies that we ate with a cold glass of milk. But then in Middle school came Fredrik. He played football and listened to “cooler music”. I kinda left Marcus behind and went with Fredrik. Marcus then followed me. I knew that he didn’t like Fredrik but he just wanted to be with me. I regret what I did and now I couldn’t get rid of Fredrik. Fredrik became even more annoying in High school when we met Alina.



Look at this view! - Said Marcus

Oh shit, that’s really cool!



You could see the beach and all the visitors! This really was a great Vacation.





Chapter V


In the evening, Marcus and I went downstairs to check on Fredrik and Alina.



- Room 69, room 69 where are you.. Here it is! - I said.



But when I were about to to knock on the door we heard something coming from the room. It sounded a little like Chewbacca mixed with a vacuum cleaner.



- Maaaaaybe we shouldn’t go in there - I said

- Yeah, I once walked in on my sister.. It wasn’t a nice sight.. - Said Marcus.



I wondered why he agreed to that tho. He didn’t seem to be interested in Alina at all. Last time we spoke about her in private he called her a slut. He had even called her that when with her. He just never gave a fuck about annyone’s feelings. Not that I like Alina. She’s a selfish little brat. She always bullies her little brother and call her parents slaves in front of them. Pure shit if you ask me.



The next day, we decided to go out. We met in the lobby.



- Where do you girls wanna go? - Fredrik said

- I don’t know.. like the mall? - Said Marcus

- Yeah! Let’s go shopping! - Said Alina.

I already knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to check out that Halloween attraction once and for all.



- What do you say, Jordan? - Fredrik asked

- I think we should check out that Halloween attraction! - I said

- Really? - Marcus said

- Oh, look! Little fatty is scared! - Fredrik said

- Stop it, jerk!

I interrupted them.

- Guys! Guys! Stop fighting! I just wanna know why they promote their place so much! But if you don’t wanna go, I’m fine with that.

- Well.. I’m on. - Said Fredrik

- Me too - Said Alina

We turned our heads to Marcus.

- Okay then! Fine! - He finally said

- Fantastic! I’ll order a cab - Fredrik said.



We arrived at the Halloween attraction. I were a little shocked. It looked just like it did in my dream! It was an old abandoned hospital in the middle of nowhere. I just stood there. totally frozen. And then, out of nowhere, I felt a wet cloth pressed against my face and I passed out.





Chapter VI


I woke up, the world was shaking. I shook my head and realised that I was moving. I sat in a wheelchair, going through a dark corridor. My hands were stuck on the chair. Every door had a number. As I passed number 66, I heard a voice.



- Here we are, young man - Someone said.



I quickly turned around.



- What? Who are you? - I asked

- I? I’m just your doctor, Young man



I froze when I saw the “doctor”. His face was pale and he only had one eye. His other eyehole had nothing in it but flies which had laid eggs in there.



- Why do you look so scared, young man?

- Where’re my friends? - I asked

- They are safe. They will be sent to the operating rooms they need, just like you

- What are you doing to us?!



By this moment I thought it was a prank, it was a Halloween attraction after all.



- Don’t look so scared, Young man. You will meet them in heaven where.. where we will ALL BE FRIENDS!



He started to laugh uncontrollably and after a while he started to cry. Not really cry but a faint sobbing.



- Okay. Whatever this is, it’s not funny! I didn’t come here to be scared! It’s May for God’s sake! - I finally said.



The “Doctor” looked down on me.



- But you came to a Halloween attraction didn’t you?



He had a point.



“Here we are”. He opened the door with the number 88 on it. “Operation room number 88” - He said.



The room was dark. It had an operation table, a bed and some other stuff. The lamp in the ceiling was flickering. He put me in the corner of the room.



- Hold still, Young man. This will be quick.

He unlocked my arm, held it tight.

- What the fuck is this? What are you doing to me?

- Shhh, shhh. Just a little operation..

- What on my hand? What are you doing to it!?



I tried to pull my hand away.



- YES! There’s a problem with your hand! Your middle finger is longer than your index finger and your ring finger, you see. Roland doesn’t like that, Roland thinks it’s ugly!

- What the fuck?! Let it go!



He slapped me. I panicked. What was this place? Was it full of these people or is it just this nut job? And where were the others? Were they being treated the same way? Or did they just leave me? No! Marcus would never do that to me! Or maybe he would?

- ROLAND DOESN’T LIKE WHEN THINGS DOESN’T MATCH! NOW HOLD STILL! - He said.



He put on an operation mask. “Don’t wanna get an infection” He said and laughed.

He then proceeded to pick up a pair of scissors. He took my hand and started to cut my finger. I screamed. I had never felt so much pain in my entire life. The blood was pouring out of my finger. I tried to think of something positive. I thought of the cookies that I used to eat when with Marcus.



- It’s done! - He said. Now we just wait for the blood to stop pouring out!

- Wha...wha.. What the FUCK?! I’m gonna bleed out, you crazy fuck!

- Yes, yes, we all will someday but even in death, you will be beautiful for little Roland to look at…



I saw how he laid my arm back on the chair. I was in shock. He was going to lai the scissors back on the table when they slipped out of his hand and landed on the floor.



- Oh! A little too bloody maybe..



And I took my chance. I kicked him between his legs as he bended down.



- OW! Roland hurt! Roland ANGRY!



He charged against me. I lifted my hand and struck him in the face. He fell backwards and the keys to the chair’s locks fell out of his pocket, just in range of my foot. I lifted the keys with my feet and gave it to my hand. I unlocked my second hand and I was free from the wheelchair. I stood up.



- NOW ROLAND REALLY ANGRY!



I took up the scissors and rammed them right into his neck! He stepped back as he choked on the sharp blades. A knife that he had in his coat was now reachable. I took it and rammed it into his neck.



He fell to the floor. He wasn‘t moving. He was dead. My mind started to come back. I tried to think. Where are the others? I must find them! I got a piece of paper from a paper roll on the floor and tied it to my middle finger.





Chapter VII


I ran down the dark corridor trying to find help. I reached the front door and tried to open it. It didn’t open.



- Fuck! - I said

But then, I heard a faint scream coming from inside the building. “It must be Alina!” - I thought. I ran into the dark with the flickering lamps as my only light. The scream got louder and louder, clearer and clearer. I soon found her. She sat in a wheelchair with a blanket over her legs.



- Alaina! Are you okay? - I asked

- Jordan? Oh my God, Thank you!



- What did they do to you, Alina?

- He..he..

She started to cry and pointed on her legs. I removed the blanket and took a few steps back from fear. Her legs had been twisted around, not her feet tho, they were still in the right way.

- He did this.. - She whimpered

“He” had separated her legs with her body and feet and twisted them around! Probably for the same reason that Roland wanted to cut my middle finger off before.



- Where are the others? - I asked

- I don’t know! - She answered

- I’m gonna get you out of here!



I grabbed her wheelchair and exited the room. I started to look for the main exit.



- Now we just have to find Marcus and Fredrik!

- No! He was the one who did it! Marcus did that.. to my legs! I always hated him!

- What? No! it can’t be!



“Hey! Where are you taking Lady-wrong-legs?!” - A voice said behind us. I turned my head and saw Marcus!



- Marcus! What the fuck!? - I said to him

- You take Lady-wrong-legs, Marcus will be very angry!



They had done something to him! I didn’t know who but someone! I started to run for the main exit!



- NO! DON’T RUN! MARCUS DOESN’T LIKE EXERCISE!





Chapter IX


We managed to shake him off in the boulding darkness and maze corridors. We got out of the main exit. It was so nice breathing fresh air again.



- What the fuck was that?! - I asked

- I don’t know.. But thanks for saving me, God knows what he could have done to me!

- My “Doctor” tried to kill me, just look what he did to me!



I showed her my finger.



- Jesus! I need to get to a real hospital! - She said

- And I need to get the police! And then we’re out of here!

- But.. What about Fredrik? - She said

- I haven’t seen him and to be frank, I’m pretty sure he just left us.

- How can you say something like that? He loves me! and I know it!

- Okay let me be the first one to tell you this: He doesn’t give a fuck about you, You’re just his ego boost. He probably took his chance to go to a strip club as soon as you weren't there!

- What kind of friend are you then? You’re just gonna leave him in there with crazy people like Marcus?

- That wasn’t the Marcus I know! They do something to the people in there! My “doctor” had one eye! He had probably been tortured the same way!



But I knew that Fredrik could still be in there, and I should at least try to look for him.



- You’re right - I finally said.

- So what do we do?

- Your arms still work, right?

- Yeah..

- You need to roll away from here. When you feel safe, call an ambulance. I’ll call the police right now.

- Right! And thanks.. for saving me.



She rolled away as fast as she could while I called the police.



- This is the Florida state Police department, can we help you? - An officer said when I called.



I explained everything and they said they were on the way.



I went back in the boulding and tried to look for Fredrik. I heard voices coming from upstairs. I climbed the old stairs to the third floor where I saw an office. In the office I could see a shadowy figure on the telephone. I got closer to the office door and looked through the door window. It was Fredrik! But he wasn’t in a wheelchair, in pain or around dirty objects. It was a rather fine office. I heard him talk.



- Yeah, she totally thinks I’m in love with her! Or thought! She won’t remember anything after another friend of mine gives her the dose!

- That other guy? Jordan you mean! Haha, he’s pretty weak. He’s probably already dead, doesn’t matter, he’s useless anyways..



I didn’t know who he was speaking too and I didn’t want to know! Me, useless? What the fuck was this?



I had no choice, I had to confront him. I slammed open the door!



- Fredrik, what the fuck!? - I said

- Jordan! What a surprise… Maybe you’re not useless after all!

- What is this shit, Fredrik?!

- My dream work! Also, most of it actually, my dad’s…

- Oh, when I’m done with you, you little...little

- Shit? You always were a little slow, Jordy!



He pulled a gun at me.



- Too bad you won’t be any faster.. - He said



I started to run but he didn’t try to shoot me, he just followed me slowly. I ran as fast as I could and finally reached the main exit when he said: “Jordy, jordy, jordy.. How do you think we got guns, this boulding and nobody up our ass?”.



The main door opened. SWAT Entered. “Finally!” - I thought to myself as the SWAT team shot me.





Chapter X


I woke up on the floor with more pain than ever. Surrounded by SWAT. Fredrik came over and showed me Alina’s head with blood dripping from it and onto my body.



- Shoot him. - Fredrik said



A SWAT officer came over to me, aimed at my head and shot.
